        <title>First Squirrels in Space Launch from Teepee</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;THE TEEPEE — This week marked an historic event in sciuridae space exploration when a team of Wildwood squirrels successfully launched a rocket from the Teepee Space Center (a bush next to the drinking fountain) in the early morning hours Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by Captain Chester T. Nuterman, the crew of the WSS Acorn is expected to land on the moon by next week, perhaps next month, according to Heironimus Bushytail, leader of the launch group’s calculations department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several failed launches earlier in the week, Mission Control celebrated exuberantly after they learned via a series of cups connected by a string that the Acorn had flown above the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just a giant leap for squirrel-kind, but for the budding Wildwood Space Program. We here at the Bugle look forward to reporting on the continued progress of the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE Oct. 15, 2015 — The Bugle has learned that the squirrel ship, the Acorn has landed on the moon. Although the flight took longer than expected, the team is nonetheless declared a mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gnomes' Cave Heist Busted by Meddling Kids</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For weeks, &lt;em&gt;The Bugle&lt;/em&gt; has received reports that small, almost insignificant, pieces of property have been going missing around the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My favorite gardening equipment went missing from my backyard recently, two small trowels and a tiny shovel,” said one resident, who did not give her name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another neighbor said that he found his favorite pair of jean shorts outside with a rectangular hole cut right out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now I need to find a new pair of shorts!” the man said. He was too embarrassed to give his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the local summer camp had some of their snacks stolen from Meadows Cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culprits are believed to be Gnomes, short magical creatures no taller than a couple feet, often “gnown” for harmless mischief and thievery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent further mayhem, wanted signs were posted at trail heads to warn hikers and residents.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hikers Spot Strange 'Horseman' in Wildwood</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two hikers reported seeing a “monster” in Wildwood Regional Park on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victor Stroganoff and Greta von Stassleberry were out walking the trails before Fourth of July fireworks when they spotted what they described as a man with the head of a horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t get a good look at it, but it was about six feet tall and had a mane like a horse and big creepy eyes,” Stroganoff said. “This was no deer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Park rangers and guests have dubbed the creature “The Horseman” since sightings of the animal began last month. Most of the sightings, including Thursday’s report, took place deep inside the canyon, passed Lizard Rock, the highest point in Wildwood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I saw the monster. He was galloping through a patch of poison oak like it was nothing,” said Wildwood Camp Director Oak, who takes dozens of kids into the canyon twice a week. “It made this gnarly sound, man. It sounded like a horse!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Park rangers have made little progress in tracking the animal in Wildwood’s rugged terrain. Biotechnology giant Amgen has also joined in the search. The company stated the animal was part of its local pharmaceutical experiments, but it went rogue after a lab accident.
“We are making every effort to retrieve the experiment,” an Amgen spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
