PARADISE FALLS &mdash; For years now, hikers have reported seeing shark-like fish in the deeper waters of Wildwood. 

The earliest claim came about five years ago. A resident living near the edge of the park apparently flushed a pet shark down the toilet, after it grew too large to keep in its tank. The baby shark eventually found its way into the creek that flows through the canyon.

But a lack of evidence has left us only to speculate, until last week when the <em>Bugle</em> received a major tip.

While hiking with her family on June 5, Erica Wamboldt snapped this picture of what appears to be a shark fin in the pond beneath Paradise Falls pond.

Whether this oceanic predator has truly made its way into the Wildwood ecosystem is yet to be seen.
