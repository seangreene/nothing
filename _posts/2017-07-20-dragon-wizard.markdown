For the past week, the <em>Bugle</em> has been flooded with reports of a large flying creature in Wildwood.

The creature is thought to be a dragon, apparently summoned by the Wildwood Wizard so he could reverse the flow of the creek and poison the park with wastewater. The situation was dire enough that the Wildwood Council of Animals mustered the aid of a band of local heroes.

With the help of the Five Sword of Wildwood, the so-called Knights of Wildwood defeated the dragon, afterward setting off to discover the identity the Wildwood Wizard.

But thanks to his ability to temporarily possess the minds of mortals, the wizard was able to elude capture. For now, at least, his true identity and motives remain unknown.
