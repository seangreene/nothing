It appears as though the myths about a half-human, half-fish creature have been finally put to rest.

On a creekside deep in the canyon, the children of a local camp have discovered the ancient remains of what appears to be a mermaid.

Dozens of bones were recovered from the dig site, however, the most important piece of all, the skull, was nowhere to be found.

When local scientists heard from a reporter about the findings, they jumped at the opportunity to research the specimen. Yet, shortly after the bones were unearthed, the samples went missing.

The world may have to wait longer yet for definitive proof of the existence of mermaids.
