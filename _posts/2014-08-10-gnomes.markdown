For weeks, <em>The Bugle</em> has received reports that small, almost insignificant, pieces of property have been going missing around the area. 

“My favorite gardening equipment went missing from my backyard recently, two small trowels and a tiny shovel,” said one resident, who did not give her name. 

Another neighbor said that he found his favorite pair of jean shorts outside with a rectangular hole cut right out of them.

“Now I need to find a new pair of shorts!” the man said. He was too embarrassed to give his name.

Even the local summer camp had some of their snacks stolen from Meadows Cave.

The culprits are believed to be Gnomes, short magical creatures no taller than a couple feet, often “gnown” for harmless mischief and thievery. 

To prevent further mayhem, wanted signs were posted at trail heads to warn hikers and residents.
