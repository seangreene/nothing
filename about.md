<strong>About the author:</strong>

I was born one night one morn, when the whistle went toot, toot. You can bake a steak or fry a cake when the mud pies are in bloom.

Does 6 and 6 make 9? Does ice grow on a vine? Is old man Joe an Eskimo in the good old summertime?

A loop-de-loop in the noodle soup, just give socks a shine. I'm guilty judge, I stole the fudge ... three cheers for Auld Lang Syne.

I cannot tell a lie, I hooked an apple pie. It's on a tree, beneath the sea, above the bright blue sky.

Easter eggs don't shave their legs; their children will have ducks. 

I'd rather buy a lemon pie for $47.

Way down in Barcelona, I jumped into the foam, but that is all balone. Patterisky blow your horn.
