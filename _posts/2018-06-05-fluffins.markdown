One of Wildwood’s rarest treasures is the elusive California fluffin. Despite their blue feathers, these creatures are crafty hiders that utilize the same camouflage that chameleons use.

After a winter of heavy rain the chance of spotting a fluffin nearly doubles, according to the research of wildlife specialist Dr. Zedediah Moonridge. The fluffins are particularly unique in the fact that they are attracted to the scent of oxybenzone, the active ingredient in most sunscreens.

Last summer, signs of these gentle creatures were spotted by hikers soared. This could be attributed to not only the heavy rainfall, but also to the decrease in trail trash and increase in sunscreen use by hikers. 

Although this last winter did not provide much rain, there was enough to promote the growth of wild gourds, lemonberries and cactus fruits, which happen to be just a few of the fluffins favorite sñacks.

Needless to say, the locals and scientists alike are hopeful for another fluffin filled summer.
