The so-called “Wildwood Wizard”: Is his purpose one of justice or trouble? It’s a debate that’s divided Wildwood locals for years.

The <em>Bugle</em> has followed the story of the silver staffed sage since the beginning. To date, there has never been any actual cause for alarm related to the wizard's activities in the park.

Past, unconfirmed reports include casting mind control spells and stealing the voices of hikers &mdash; and conjuring frightful images of flying dragons. 

Unbeknownst to most, the Wildwood Wizard has been spotted performing good deeds as well: Helping little ducklings across rattlesnake infested fields, using his magic to help cacti bloom in the drought and even reportedly deterred Horseman from entering a residential area.

“He’s a crook who needs to be put behind bars,” declares Agnus Jenkins, a local resident.

Others like avid hiker Harold Toppinton thinks differently. 

“He’s the guardian that Wildwood deserves, his harmless tricks are only used to teach us,” he told this reporter while hiking near Lizard Rock.

It seems it’s up to the individual whether this character is good or evil.
