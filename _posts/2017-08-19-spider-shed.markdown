Rabbit populations declined significantly year with the recent introduction of a new species of giant spider discovered in the park this year, ‎<em>Hogna persulensis</em>. 

This species is closely related to the California wolf spider, except it is a darker shade of brown and is reportedly several times larger. Scientists have found molted skin measuring more than two feet in length.

Several of these spiders had reportedly created a living space under a shed in the park a year ago, but it appears they have since moved out.

“Every morning I walk Rex through the park, but I haven’t seen any since last August, not even a web,” said local dog walker George Jenkins.

For several months, there were no signs of the spiders, but this reporter kept digging. 

Volunteers were recently seen clearing up a section of trial near Meadows Cave of large string like webbing stretched across the trial. The trail was unusually crowded that morning, as dozens of people worked to discard the debris.

It remains to be seen whether the spiders have increased their range in the park.
