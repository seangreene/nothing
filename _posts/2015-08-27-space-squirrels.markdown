THE TEEPEE — This week marked an historic event in sciuridae space exploration when a team of Wildwood squirrels successfully launched a rocket from the Teepee Space Center (a bush next to the drinking fountain) in the early morning hours Sunday.

Led by Captain Chester T. Nuterman, the crew of the WSS Acorn is expected to land on the moon by next week, perhaps next month, according to Heironimus Bushytail, leader of the launch group’s calculations department.

After several failed launches earlier in the week, Mission Control celebrated exuberantly after they learned via a series of cups connected by a string that the Acorn had flown above the clouds.

This is not just a giant leap for squirrel-kind, but for the budding Wildwood Space Program. We here at the Bugle look forward to reporting on the continued progress of the mission.

UPDATE Oct. 15, 2015 &mdash; The Bugle has learned that the squirrel ship, the Acorn has landed on the moon. Although the flight took longer than expected, the team is nonetheless declared a mission accomplished.
