On Thursday, authorites slammed shut what will likely be remembered as the biggest Frozen Fruit-Flavored Liquid Treat heist of the century &mdash; right here in Wildwood.

Two individuals were arrested in connection with the case, which began months ago when a large shipment of the frozen confections was reported stolen from a nearby warehouse.

The massive search was conducted by a multi-agency task force, which had officers fanning the state and conducting aerial surveys to find the missing merchandise &mdash; and the perpetrators.

Eventually, a series of clues led investigators to Wildwood. By following a trail of the little plastic bits that are torn from the end of the tube to consume the dessert, federal agents found the cache of &lsquo;pops in a cave.

Results of a juice analysis confirmed the Wildwood &lsquo;pops indeed came from the stolen shipment.

Plastic litter is a serious crime against the environment, and was treated as such by the authorites. Although one of the perpetrators was released on a plea deal, the other was sentenced to manual labor in the ice mines of Greenland.

Often called by a name brand, Frozen Fruit-Flavored Liquid Treats are known to carry tremendous capital in this area, especially on hot summer days.

Please, on behalf of all Wildwood&rsquo;s precious wildlife, remember to pick up all your trash while enjoying the trails.
